###################Single inheritance######################
# In single inheritance, there is only a single class extending from another class.
# We can take the example of the Vehicle class as the parent class, and the Car class as the child class. Letâ€™s implement these classes below:

class Vehicle:  # parent class
    def setTopSpeed(self, speed):  # defining the set
        self.topSpeed = speed
        print("Top speed is set to", self.topSpeed)


class Car(Vehicle):  # child class
    def openTrunk(self):
        print("Trunk is now open.")


corolla = Car()  # creating an object of the Car class
corolla.setTopSpeed(220)  # accessing methods from the parent class
corolla.openTrunk()  # accessing method from its own class

#################Multilevel Inheritence##################
# When a class is derived from a class which itself is derived from another class,
# it is called multilevel inheritance. We can extend the classes to as many levels as we want to.

class Vehicle:  # parent class
    def setTopSpeed(self, speed):  # defining the set
        self.topSpeed = speed
        print("Top speed is set to", self.topSpeed)


class Car(Vehicle):  # child class of Vehicle
    def openTrunk(self):
        print("Trunk is now open.")


class Hybrid(Car):  # child class of Car
    def turnOnHybrid(self):
        print("Hybrid mode is now switched on.")


priusPrime = Hybrid()  # creating an object of the Hybrid class
priusPrime.setTopSpeed(220)  # accessing methods from the parent class
priusPrime.openTrunk()  # accessing method from the parent class
priusPrime.turnOnHybrid()  # accessing method from the child class


#####################Hierarchical inheritance#####################
# In hierarchical inheritance, more than one class extends, as per the requirement of the design,
# from the same base class. The common attributes of these child classes are implemented inside the base class.

class Vehicle:  # parent class
    def setTopSpeed(self, speed):  # defining the set
        self.topSpeed = speed
        print("Top speed is set to", self.topSpeed)


class Car(Vehicle):  # child class of Vehicle
    pass


class Truck(Vehicle):  # child class of Vehicle
    pass


corolla = Car()  # creating an object of the Car class
corolla.setTopSpeed(220)  # accessing methods from the parent class

volvo = Truck()  # creating an object of the Truck class
volvo.setTopSpeed(180)  # accessing methods from the parent class

############Multiple Inheritence###############
# When a class is derived from more than one base class, i.e., when a class has more than one immediate parent class, it is called multiple inheritance.
#
# Example:
#
# HybridEngine IS A ElectricEngine.
# HybridEngine IS A CombustionEngine as well.
class CombustionEngine():
    def setTankCapacity(self, tankCapacity):
        self.tankCapacity = tankCapacity


class ElectricEngine():
    def setChargeCapacity(self, chargeCapacity):
        self.chargeCapacity = chargeCapacity

# Child class inherited from CombustionEngine and ElectricEngine
class HybridEngine(CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine):
    def printDetails(self):
        print("Tank Capacity:", self.tankCapacity)
        print("Charge Capacity:", self.chargeCapacity)

car = HybridEngine()
car.setChargeCapacity("250 W")
car.setTankCapacity("20 Litres")
car.printDetails()

###########Hybrid inheritance
# A type of inheritance which is a combination of Multiple and Multi-level inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.
#
# CombustionEngine IS A Engine.
# ElectricEngine IS A Engine.
# HybridEngine IS A ElectricEngine and a CombustionEngine.

class Engine:  # Parent class
    def setPower(self, power):
        self.power = power


class CombustionEngine(Engine):  # Child class inherited from Engine
    def setTankCapacity(self, tankCapacity):
        self.tankCapacity = tankCapacity


class ElectricEngine(Engine):  # Child class inherited from Engine
    def setChargeCapacity(self, chargeCapacity):
        self.chargeCapacity = chargeCapacity

# Child class inherited from CombustionEngine and ElectricEngine


class HybridEngine(CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine):
    def printDetails(self):
        print("Power:", self.power)
        print("Tank Capacity:", self.tankCapacity)
        print("Charge Capacity:", self.chargeCapacity)


car = HybridEngine()
car.setPower("2000 CC")
car.setChargeCapacity("250 W")
car.setTankCapacity("20 Litres")
car.printDetails()
